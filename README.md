# Writer

Writer is a wordpress theme building by react. I try not to add any hooks to wordpress to make the theme have the best compability. 

It can be used out of box, but to make sure all functions working properly, please set:
- Wordpress permanant link as /posts/%postname%,
- Add two pages: About and message board with their slugs as /about-myself and /guestbook respectively.

Implemented function:
- index page
- Post list
- post page
- dedicated page
- comment
- category

All needed functions are completed.
